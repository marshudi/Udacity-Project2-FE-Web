## Description

The Landing Page project is a web page that serves as an interactive landing page with smooth scrolling and a dynamically generated navigation menu. The goal of this project is to convert a static web page into an interactive one by adding functionality using JavaScript. The page consists of multiple sections, and the navigation menu is dynamically generated based on these sections. When a navigation item is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
