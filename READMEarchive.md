## Instructions

The starter project includes HTML and CSS files that display a static version of the Landing Page project. Your task is to convert this project into an interactive one by modifying the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and begin building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, refer to the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

## Development

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. In your development folder, open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the command `npx http-server -c-1 -o` to start a local development server with caching disabled.
3. The default browser should automatically open with the project running. If it doesn't, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` or the provided URL.
4. Make changes to the code, save the files, and then reload the browser to see the applied changes.

## ES6

This project utilizes several ES6 methods and JavaScript features that are only available in modern browsers. These include the usage of `IntersectionObserver`. The project is compatible with most modern browsers.

Most of the changes have been made in the `js/app.js` file, with some additional styling changes in `styles.css`.

## Enhancements

This project has been enhanced with the following features:

- Dynamic generation of the navigation menu based on the sections.
- Smooth scrolling to the corresponding section when a navigation item is clicked.
